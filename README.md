An automated car with lidar sensor simulation

to run CoppeliaSim (emulator) :
    ./run_coppelia.sh

now you can run project with :
    ./run_ia python
or
    ./run_ia c

In C I use several curves to choose the speed or direction of the car.

In python I use Q-learning a technique in reinforcing learning (Not done Yet, I am working on it)
